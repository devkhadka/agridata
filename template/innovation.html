                        <p align="justify">The basic purpose of establishing the company was not only to supply the input materials to the needed areas for increasing the productivity but also to find out the real field situation and the ways of eliminating those problems. For that we choose research and development of the product rather than hit and trail method. In view with the farmers in different locations, first of all their problems were identified by a panel of experts and from the feedback given by them and the problem was brought up in the laboratory. The laboratory experiments were carried out on the products and the results was analyzed on the daily basis. After the completion of the laboratory experiments further experiments were carried out in different location of the country differing in climatic situation.  And the records obtained from those experiments were analyzed. The comparison between those data was made and final analysis was made by the expert.  After getting the green signal from the panel of experts the product was launched.<br><br>
						
The research and development laboratory is mainly based on on-field and off-field experiments. The basis of conduction of experiments was set by the panel of experts. Currently the focus point of research is on the insect pest of the field and their control through the biological means.  The company has been successful in launching the products to control the insect pest by biological means i.e. biological insecticides and pesticides have been launched with succession. In the field of pathology, biological fungicides have been successfully developed after experimentation on different location of Nepal (we are unable to reveal the places of research on the field as per the company policy).

Initially the research focused on the micro-nutrients applicability in the plants as they are the building blocks of the plants.  The sole conclusion of the research came in the form of biological insect pest control as it was clear on the reports that with the application of required amount of micro-nutrients on the on-field and 0ff-field trial the productivity were diminishing, and the cause was crystal clear with the name insect pest. So the expert group decided that without the control over the insect pest of the crops it was impossible to increase the productivity with the resources that could be made available by the famers. And so, the secondary priority got the first place and efforts were raised to the new activity of research, eliminating the insect pest of the crop without any harmful effects to the consumer and the crop field. That could only be achieved by the control of the enemies of the crops i.e. insect pest in a biological manner. And so the concept came into existence.
